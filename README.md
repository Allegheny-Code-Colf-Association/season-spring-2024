# CMPSC 201: Programming Languages Code Golf

This repository houses the Spring 2024 season of the Allegheny Code Golf Association. If enrolled in the Spring 2024 `CMPSC 201` course at Allegheny
College, refer to the [course syllabus](https://github.com/allegheny-college-cmpsc-201-spring-2024/course-materials/blob/main/README.md) for more 
information about evaluation and completion.

## Rules

The golfer with the lowest score wins.

The more specific rules are simple: 

* achieve the task required by the round's `README` in _as few bytes as possible_
* the number of bytes taken by your solution will be added to your score
* unless required to use a specific language, you are welcome, invited, and encouraged to read widely on languages that best fit the problem
* only submissions completed by the round completion date will count toward global statstics
* if your submission is more than `1000` bytes, your score will be counted as a "bogey" and increment by only `1000` bytes
* if enrolling, but failing to submit a round, your score will automatically increment by one "bogey" for that round

### Participation

Only golfers who use their assignment golf repository will be scored and ranked. See the above registration form to register and receieve
a link to an official copy of the repository, which:

* will be a fork of the main season repository
* will require you to update the repository on a weekly basis, when new rounds are released
* each round will be released in a numbered folder representing the round
  * i.e., `1` represents Round 1

Participants who fill out the registration form will be emailed when a new round is released.

## Leaderboards

There are two leaderboards: an _internal_ one for the aforementioned `CMPSC 201` course and an open-rank leader board for all others interested
in participating in this very serious endeavor. To enroll in the Open-rank Leaderboard, please fill out this entry form:

* [Spring 2024 Season Open-Rank Entry Form](https://chompe.rs/acga-spring-2024-registration)

Entries for the Open-Rank league close on 22 January 2024.
